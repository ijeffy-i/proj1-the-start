# The Start 📍

## Overview  
This project marks a new step in documenting my journey as a Data Analyst. While it’s not my first project, it serves as a snapshot of my current progress—capturing what I’ve learned, where I stand, and how I aim to grow. As I take on more projects, I plan to refine and expand this work, continually improving my skills and approach along the way.

🗺️ EDA - Used Tableau to plot the data.  
🔗 [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jeffy.i/viz/NTCrimeStatistics-AnAnalysisProject/CrimesRecordedbyYear)

🗺️ EDA - Check Per Capita Crime Rates → Confirm if Darwin & Alice Springs have higher crime density or if it's due to population size.  
🔎 Explored the top 3 regions with the highest count of offences recorded:

1. Darwin Population: 255,559 → 126.6 Crimes per 1000 people (🔗 [Population Ref.](https://nteconomy.nt.gov.au/population))
2. Alice Springs Pop.: 29,693 → 885.5 Crimes per 1000 people (🔗 [Population Ref.](https://profile.id.com.au/rda-northern-territory/population-estimate?WebID=100))

#### **11/04**
✅ Downloaded more previous Crime statistics datasets - currently exploring data between 2022 and 2025.  
🧼 Combined CSV files.  
🧼 Cleaned names of files - ran into an error where offence_type and offence_category had duplicates due to spelling (eg. Injury/injury and Murder/murder).  
✅ Uploaded new CSV (final_crime_data_22to25).  
✅ Replaced Data source in Tableau for a more thorough EDA.  

#### **12/04**
✅ EDA - Deep Dive into Alice Springs Crime Trends  
🔎 Extracted Alice Springs' population data from 2018 to 2024 - Discovered a surge of crimes post 2020.


### **Upcoming Next**  
🔜 Find Explanations for the Crime Surge (2021–2022)  

1. Examine socio-economic factors, policing policies, or transient populations that might influence crime density.
2. Identify which crimes contribute most to the high rate—violent crimes, theft, or repeat offenses?
