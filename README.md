# The Start 📍

## Overview  
This project marks a new step in documenting my journey as a Data Analyst. While it’s not my first project, it serves as a snapshot of my current progress—capturing what I’ve learned, where I stand, and how I aim to grow. As I take on more projects, I plan to refine and expand this work, continually improving my skills and approach along the way.
